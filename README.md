# lenshift

Lenshift is a simple encryption tool. It is not meant to be used for serious encryption, but rather for fun.

## CLI

There are two subcommands: `encode` and `decode`. Both take a single argument: the text to encrypt/decrypt.
The result is printed to stdout.

### Useage

`lenshift encode|decode <text>`
